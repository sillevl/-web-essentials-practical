# Course landing page

For this exercise you can be creative.

The goal is to create a landing page for all of your exercises. The landing page should show an overview of all the exercises you have solved.

This list could be created in an easy way with just a HTML unordered list, or you can make it more chalanging by showing images, titles in cards with rows and columns (not a table).

Make sure every item in the list links to the resulting exercise. Making it easy to navigate to all the solutions.
