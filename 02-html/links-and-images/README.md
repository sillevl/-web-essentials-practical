# Links and images

Build a small webpage using only HTML. You can choose a topic of your own interest. If you have no inspiration, create a webpage about computer parts, games, movies, music artist, sports, animals, plants,... Find an other website that contains information about the topic. You can copy/paste the text and/or images from that source website so that you do not have to write it yourself. Be careful to mention your source correctly in your solution.

The webpages need to meet the following requirements:

* 1 Introduction/overview page that functions as the main page to visit for end users.
  * The page should contain _at least_ 1 paragraph of text introducing the topic.
  * The page should contain links to some subpages (described below).
* 3 Subpages that contain detailed information about the chosen topic.
  * Every page should contain _at least_ 3 paragraphs of text.
  * Every page should have an image _banner_ at the top of the page.
    * Images should have a maximum resolution of 800px horizontal and 400 pixels vertical.
  * Every page should have a link at the bottom of the page that brings you to the top of the page
  * Every page should have a link at the bottom of the page that brings you to the introduction/overview page
  * Every page should have a link that takes you to the source website where you copy/pasted the content of.

Note: it is not necesairy to copy/past the whole source website or page, just do what is needed to meet the minimum requirements.
